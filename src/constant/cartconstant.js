                             Thought Note

Here I created  constants for Redux actions related to shopping cart functionality :

=>  ADD_TO_CART: an action to add an item to the shopping cart.
=>  REMOVE_FROM_CART: an action to remove an item from the shopping cart.
=>  CART_RESET: an action to reset the shopping cart, clearing all items. 


 */
export const ADD_TO_CART = "ADD_TO_CART";
export const REMOVE_FROM_CART = "REMOVE_FROM_CART";
export const CART_RESET = "CART_RESET";
